#+TITLE: XMonad Config
#+AUTHOR: Christian Hageloch
#+STARTUP: showeverything

This is my XMonad Configuration. It is very minimal by design.

* Table of Contents :toc:
- [[#features][Features]]
- [[#installation][Installation]]

* Features
- No bar, no scratchpads (yes that is a feature, because nobody needs a bar or scratchpads if they use window rules)
- custom window rules (the killer feature of standalone window managers)
- keyboard shortcuts with XMonad.Util.EZConfig for easy key declaration and keychords
- keyboard shortcut for sticky clients

* Installation
- Install xmonad and xmonad-contrib
  #+begin_src bash
    sudo pacman -S xmonad xmonad-contrib
  #+end_src
- clone the repository
  ,#+begin_src bash
    git clone https://github.com/chriswifn/xmonad-config.git ~/.config/xmonad
  #+end_src
