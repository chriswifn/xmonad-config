#+TITLE: XMonad Config
#+AUTHOR: Christian Hageloch
#+STARTUP: showeverything

This is my XMonad Configuration. I switch between a Treeselect and Projects workflow (one branch for each)

* Features
** main branch:
- organize workspaces in a tree
  - Treeselect 
  - dedicate different tasks to a different set of workspaces
- keyboard shortcuts with XMonad.Util.EZConfig for easy key declaration and keychords
- Dwm like "tag"-functionality (no merging but sticky) 
** dynamicprojects branch: 
- organize workspaces in projects:
  - launch certain applications in a selected workspace
  - ability to change project directory: useful when working in a specific directory all the time
  - merging projects together (kindof like dwm but not really)
- keyboard shortcuts with XMonad.Util.EZConfig for easy key declaration and keychords
- Dwm like "tag"-functionality (no merging but sticky) 

* Installation
- Install xmonad and xmonad-contrib
  #+begin_src bash
    sudo pacman -S xmonad xmonad-contrib
  #+end_src
- clone the repository
  #+begin_src bash
    git clone https://github.com/chriswifn/xmonad-config.git ~/.config/xmonad
  #+end_src
