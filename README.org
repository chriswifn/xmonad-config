#+TITLE: XMonad Config
#+AUTHOR: Christian Hageloch
#+STARTUP: showeverything

This is my XMonad Configuration. It is very minimal by design.

* Table of Contents :toc:
- [[#features][Features]]
- [[#installation][Installation]]

* Features
- No bar: I use window rules an ShowWName (yes that is a feature)
- custom window rules (the killer feature of standalone window managers)
- keyboard shortcuts with XMonad.Util.EZConfig for easy key declaration and keychords
- Dwm like "tag"-functionality (it is not the same as dwm but it works for me)

* Installation
- Install xmonad and xmonad-contrib
  #+begin_src bash
    sudo pacman -S xmonad xmonad-contrib
  #+end_src
- clone the repository
  #+begin_src bash
    git clone https://github.com/chriswifn/xmonad-config.git ~/.config/xmonad
  #+end_src
