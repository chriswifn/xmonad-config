This is my XMonad Configuration. It is very minimal by design.

* Table of Contents :toc:
- [[#what-is-does-not-have][What is does not have]]
- [[#what-it-does-have][What it does have]]
- [[#installation][Installation]]

* What is does not have
- A bar (no XMobar, no Polybar), because a bar is pointless when using window rules
- No scratchpads, because scratchpads are pointless when using window rules
- No custom prompts because I don't know what I would use them for (I use custom [[https://github.com/chriswifn/dotfiles/tree/main/home/.local/bin/dmenu][dmenu scripts]].)
- ... 

* What it does have
- Window rules (the killer feature of standalone window managers)
- Keyboard shortcuts setup with XMonad.Util.EZConfig
- sticky Clients

* Installation
- Install xmonad and xmonad-contrib
- clone the repository
  #+begin_src bash
    git clone https://github.com/chriswifn/xmonad-config.git ~/.config/xmonad
  #+end_src
